# Finance Tracker — Claude Internal Reference

## Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Deploy**: `npm run deploy` → gh-pages branch → gamboiuwu.github.io/finance-prog
- **Router**: HashRouter (required for gh-pages static hosting)
- **No backend** — all data lives in the user's private Google Sheet

## Auth & Security
- Google OAuth2 popup → access token stored in `localStorage` (expires ~1 hr)
- PIN hashed via SubtleCrypto in `src/lib/pin.js`; idle timeout re-locks session
- All API calls: browser → Google Sheets API v4 directly (no proxy server)
- **Never commit** the spreadsheet ID to public files — it is in `src/config.js` which is gitignored-safe since no financial data is in the ID itself, but the sheet is private-only-accessible via OAuth

## Google Sheets Layout
| Sheet tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Monthly Summary | Income/spent/goal per month (rows = months, cols = metrics) |
| Monthly Expenses | Budget categories: Type, Account, Priority, Monthly Allowance ($), etc. |
| Allocation Transactions | Every deposit: Date, Type, Amount, Desc, Account, Done (bool) |
| Business Products | Product cards: ID, Name, StartPrice, Formula (JSON blocks) |
| Business Transactions | Sales log: Date, Client, Product, Qty, Unit Price, Revenue, Margin%, Allocs(JSON) |
| Subscriptions | Subscription items: Name, Cost, Cycle, Start Date, Account |

**Spreadsheet ID**: `1RNhMNI3nM3dZisuP8vo2w6FYnx33Lvnvpe_UnHdGz4o`  
**Google Client ID**: see `src/config.js`

## BusinessExpenses.jsx — Key Concepts
- **Product formula**: array of blocks `{id, category, type ('fixed'|'percent'), value, customName?}`
- `computeFormula(startPrice, blocks)` — waterfall: each block takes from `remaining`
- `computeFormulaProportional(actualRevenue, basePrice, blocks)` — scales fixed amounts by revenue/basePrice ratio
- **Profit = 'Profit' + 'Revenue' allocation categories** — both are summed for the Profit tile and Process button
- `profitMarginPct(steps, startPrice)` — returns combined (Profit+Revenue)/startPrice %
- `BUILT_IN_CATS` — dropdown options for formula blocks (Revenue now included)
- Sales tab reads `Business Transactions!A:H`; col H is `allocs` JSON `{category: amount}`

## ProcessIncome.jsx — Key Concepts
- Reads `Allocation Transactions!A:F` to find already-deposited amounts this month
- `calcDeposits(expenses, income, mode, alreadyByType)` — returns per-category deposit amounts
- Two modes: `priority` (fill P1 → P2 → P3) and `proportional` (split by share of remaining need)
- Surplus: income beyond all goals distributed by user-configured weight buckets

## Dashboard.jsx — Key Concepts
- Loads on mount: Monthly Summary, Monthly Expenses, Report Links, Gas Price, Subscriptions
- Subscriptions stored in `Subscriptions!A:E`, cycle types: monthly/annual/weekly/biweekly
- Bill Calendar: shows 30-day window with subscription due-date dots
- Month Close: stores `closed_{month}_{year}` in localStorage (soft close only)
- Statement: `printStatement()` generates a printable HTML page via `window.open()`

### Task Status
| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Subscriptions — add/edit/delete | ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED |
| 2 | Category view shows all allocated amounts | ⏳ Plan written, awaiting Execute Y/N |
| 3 | Revenue counts as Profit in Sales card | ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED (2026-05-22) |
| 4 | Business Expenses full accounting page | ⏳ Plan written, awaiting Execute Y/N |

## Git Workflow
1. Source changes → feature branch (e.g. `claude/zealous-euler-p8sWK`) based on `main`
2. PR: feature → `main`
3. Deploy: `npm run deploy` on `main` → builds dist/ → pushes to `gh-pages`

## Security Checklist
- [ ] No API keys or tokens in source code or commit history
- [ ] No financial data (amounts, sheet contents) in GitHub
- [ ] All user data stays in their private Google Sheet
- [ ] Google OAuth scope is `spreadsheets` only (not drive, gmail, etc.)
- [ ] PIN prevents unauthorized access if device is shared
