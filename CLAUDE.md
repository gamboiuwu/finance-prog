# Finance Tracker — Claude Internal Reference

> **📐 Full system reconciliation lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** — every

## Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Deploy**: `npm run deploy` → gh-pages branch → gamboiuwu.github.io/finance-prog
- **Router**: HashRouter (required for gh-pages static hosting)
- **No backend** — all data lives in the user's private Google Sheet

## Auth & Security
- Google OAuth2 popup → access token stored in `localStorage` (expires ~1 hr)
- PIN hashed via SubtleCrypto in `src/lib/pin.js`; idle timeout re-locks session
- All API calls: browser → Google Sheets API v4 directly (no proxy server)
- **Never commit** the spreadsheet ID to public files — it is in `src/config.js` which is gitignored-safe since no financial data is in the ID itself, but the sheet is private-only-accessible via OAuth

## Google Sheets Layout
*(Full column-level detail + which screen reads/writes each tab is in ARCHITECTURE.md §2.)*
| Sheet tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Monthly Summary | Income/spent/goal per month (rows = months, cols = metrics) |
| Monthly Expenses | Budget categories: Type, Account, Priority, Expense, Monthly Allowance ($), Actual Spend |
| Allocation Transactions | Every deposit/spend: Date, Type, Amount, Desc, Account, Done (bool) |
| Allocation Summary | label/balance pairs incl. **Gas** row (gas balance on hand) — read by Summary |
| Expense Summary | wide key/value layout (PI, CI, wage, mpg, $/gal, deposits) — read by Summary |
| Subscriptions | Subscription items: Name, Start Date, Cycle, Amount, Notes |
| Inquiries | Commission inquiries: Card Name, Contact, desc, Status, Price Agreed, Paid Amount… |
| Commission Prices | Pricing tiers: ID,Category,Variant,BasePrice,ExtraChar,Bg*,RushPct,CommercialPct,… |
| Business Products | Product cards: ID, Name, StartPrice, Formula (JSON blocks) |
| Business Transactions | Sales log: Date, Client, Product, Qty, Unit Price, Revenue, Margin%, Allocs(JSON), Order(JSON) |
| Business Account Spending | Owner draws + direct bucket spends: Date, Account, Amount, Vendor, Description |
| Business Expenses | Business spending log: Date, Vendor, Amount, Category, Product, Payment, Notes |
| Work Sessions | Time-clock log: Date, Start, Duration, Products, Total Units, Total Profit, $/hr, Notes |
| Plans | Savings/affordability goals (Dragon/Goals): ID,Name,Scope,Target,Saved,Per Month,… |

**Subsystems beyond the budget core** (see ARCHITECTURE.md §3 for formulas):
Business (`BusinessExpenses.jsx`, 6 tabs incl. time clock) · Commissions (`CommissionPrices` +
`Commissions`) · Time Clock (`TimeClockView`, `Work Sessions` sheet) · Dragon AI assistant
(`DragonBot` + `lib/dragon*`, user's own Anthropic key) · Goals (`Goals.jsx` + `Plans` sheet) ·
Orders/shipping (`lib/orders`, `lib/easypost`, EasyPost via CORS proxy).

## BusinessExpenses.jsx — Key Concepts
- **Product formula**: array of blocks `{id, category, type ('fixed'|'percent'), value, customName?}`
- `computeFormula(startPrice, blocks)` — waterfall: each block takes from `remaining`
- `computeFormulaProportional(actualRevenue, basePrice, blocks)` — scales fixed amounts by revenue/basePrice ratio
- **Profit = 'Profit' + 'Revenue' allocation categories** — both are summed for the Profit tile and Process button
- `profitMarginPct(steps, startPrice)` — returns combined (Profit+Revenue)/startPrice %
- **Unified category model (the source of truth — see the big comment block at top of the file):**
  - `BUILT_IN_CATS` — all formula-block categories (incl. Profit/Revenue/Other)
  - `CAT_COLORS` + `catColor(name)` — ONE colour lookup for every tab (replaced the old `EXP_CAT_COLORS`)
  - `EXP_CATEGORIES = BUILT_IN_CATS minus Profit/Revenue` (profit isn't a spendable cost)
- **Per-category ledger** (shared by Accounts + Insights): `balance(C) = earned(C) − spent(C)` where
  `earned(C)` = Σ sales allocs[C], `spent(C)` = Σ `Business Account Spending`[Account=C] + Σ `Business Expenses`[Category=C].
  Profit/Revenue rows tagged "processed as personal income" are owner draws → excluded from P&L costs (`IS_OWNER_DRAW`).
- **Tabs** (`viewMode`): `products` (Cards/Compare sub-toggle via `productView`) · `sales` · `accounts` · `expenses` · `insights`
- Sales tab reads `Business Transactions!A:H`; col H is `allocs` JSON `{category: amount}`
- **Accounts 🏦 tab** — `AccountsView`; now reads all 3 sheets so an Expenses-tab spend reduces the matching bucket balance (the Accounts↔Expenses sync). Modal history merges direct spends + expense rows (📒 tag).
- **Expenses 📒 tab** — `ExpensesTab`; reads/writes `Business Expenses!A:G`
  - Reorder thresholds stored in `localStorage` as `biz_reorder_thresholds` (JSON keyed by product ID)
  - `ThresholdModal` — set COGS threshold per product · `ReorderQAModal` — guided Q&A + copy-to-clipboard
- **Insights 📈 tab** — `InsightsView`; 3 tools, all reconcile with the ledger above:
  1. **P&L statement** (period: month/year/all) — Revenue − COGS = Gross; − OpEx = Net; net margin %
  2. **Spending Trend** — last-6-month bar chart of actual cash-out + MoM delta
  3. **Top Vendors** — ranked vendor spend with share % (from both spending sheets)
  - `monthKey(v)` normalises serial/`YYYY-MM-DD`/`M/D/YYYY` dates to `YYYY-MM` so all sheets bucket together

## ProcessIncome.jsx — Key Concepts
- Reads `Allocation Transactions!A:F` to find already-deposited amounts this month
- `calcDeposits(expenses, income, mode, alreadyByType)` — returns per-category deposit amounts
- Two modes: `priority` (fill P1 → P2 → P3) and `proportional` (split by share of remaining need)
- Surplus: income beyond all goals distributed by user-configured weight buckets

## Dashboard.jsx — Key Concepts
- Loads on mount: Monthly Summary, Monthly Expenses, Report Links, Gas Price, Subscriptions
- Subscriptions stored in `Subscriptions!A:E`, cycle types: monthly/annual/weekly/biweekly
- Bill Calendar: shows 30-day window with subscription due-date dots
- Month Close: stores `closed_{month}_{year}` in localStorage (soft close only)
- Statement: `printStatement()` generates a printable HTML page via `window.open()`

## Budget.jsx — Key Concepts (updated 2026-06-02)
- 3 tabs rendered: **Budget** (priority-grouped edit view) | **Categories** | **Entries & Trends**
- **Categories** reads `Allocation Transactions!A:F` (UNFORMATTED_VALUE) for current month → sums by `Type` (col B) → maps against `Monthly Expenses` allowances → groups by `Expense` category (Essentials/Stability/Discretionary/Subscription). Savings items shown separately/collapsible.
- **Entries** = flat sorted list of raw allocation rows for current month
- **Trends** = 3-month comparison (current, last, 2 months ago). `allAllocTx` state holds ALL allocation rows (not just current month); `allocTx` is filtered to current month. Load fetches all rows once; both states populated from the same API call. `Sparkline` renders inline SVG bars (48×24px, 3 bars). `TrendsView` groups by expense category, shows delta arrows + sparklines per item.
- `parseSheetDate(val)` duplicated in ProcessIncome.jsx — consider extracting to `src/lib/dateUtils.js`
- Allocation Transactions column B ("Type") matches Monthly Expenses column "Type" (item name like "Rent", not the expense category)

### New Tasks 32–34 (from Report-Issue feedback, 2026-06-04) — awaiting Execute Y/N
- **Task 32 — Income Figure Consistency**: Multiple Report-Issue submissions (2026-05-30, 06-01, 06-03 ×several) say income shows wrong/inconsistent numbers across tabs (Dashboard `$2,408.93`/`$2,901.88` vs. actual ≈$750 for the month; Summary "PROCESSED INCOME $1676.39 — not income logged this month"; "Income is incorrect in this tab"). Root cause: Dashboard already treats current-month Allocation-Transaction totals as ground truth (Dashboard.jsx:782-788) to dodge stale Monthly-Summary sheet formulas, but Summary, Trends, and the 6-month chart still read the raw Monthly Summary cells, which carry last month's value into a fresh month. PLAN: (a) extract one shared helper `currentMonthIncome(allocRows, monthlySummaryRow)` into `src/lib/income.js` that mirrors Dashboard's ground-truth logic (alloc totals when current-month rows exist, else sheet); (b) use it in Summary (PI tile), Budget Trends, and any place reading `Total Processed Income` for the *current* month; (c) leave completed/past months reading the sheet (they're frozen). Q1: Should "income logged this month" count only positive deposit rows, or net (deposits − spends)? Q2: Is the canonical month-income definition "sum of Allocation Transactions income-type rows" or "Processed Income (PI) from Expense Summary"? Q3: should past months ever be back-corrected from allocations, or stay as the sheet snapshot? Execute? Y/N:
- **Task 33 — Spending Calendar shows income as spending (bug)**: Feedback 2026-06-03T17:24 — the Dashboard "Spending Calendar" heatmap colors days by *earnings* not *spending* ("it's SHOWING income as expenses"). PLAN: in the heatmap day-bucket reducer, split signed amounts — spending = Σ negative rows (abs) → rose scale; income = Σ positive rows → teal dot; never color a day rose from an income row. Audit the same sign-handling everywhere a daily/category "spent" total is computed so the mistake isn't repeated. Q1: should transfers between own accounts be excluded from both? Q2: keep the calendar on Dashboard or move to Budget→Entries per Task 24's answer? Execute? Y/N:
- **Task 34 — "Close Month" banner persists after close (bug)**: Feedback 2026-06-03T16:55 & 17:22 — "may is already closed" / "It keeps asking me to close out May…I clicked the button." The Dashboard close-month banner keys off `closed_{month}_{year}` localStorage but still renders after close. PLAN: gate the banner on the same `closed_{closeMonth}_{closeYear}` key that the Close action writes; verify the key name/casing matches exactly (`MONTHS[closeDate.getMonth()]` + year); add a fallback that also hides the banner once the new month has its own allocation rows. Q1: should "close" be device-local (localStorage) or persisted to the sheet so it syncs across devices? Q2: after closing, show a small "✓ May closed" confirmation chip instead of the banner? Execute? Y/N:

### New Tasks 35–37 (best-practice expansions proposed 2026-06-05) — awaiting Execute Y/N
- **Task 35 — Emergency Fund / Runway Tracker**: A standard personal-finance resilience metric the app doesn't show yet: *how many months could you survive on savings if income stopped?* PLAN: (a) **Monthly burn** = sum of P1 (essential) + P2 (stability) `Monthly Expenses` allowances (the bills you can't skip) — same set the Income Forecast (Task 16) already computes, so the two reconcile. (b) **Savings on hand** = sum of `Allocation Summary` balance rows whose label is a savings/cash bucket (or `Monthly Expenses` items with `Expense='Savings'` actuals) — reuse the balances Summary already reads. (c) **Runway = savings ÷ burn**, shown as a Dashboard card: "🛟 X.X months covered" with a 3-tier color (red <1mo, amber 1–3mo, teal ≥3mo) and a thin progress bar against a configurable target (default 3 months, the common floor; 6 months = fully funded). (d) Tap to expand: the burn breakdown and a "you're $X away from a 3-month cushion" line. Zero new sheet tab; new localStorage `_fin_ef_target` (int months, default 3 — no financial data). Q1: Which buckets count as "emergency savings" — all Savings-category items, or a specific named bucket (e.g. "Emergency")? Q2: Target floor of 3 months, or do you prefer 6? Q3: Dashboard card, or a panel inside Summary→Year? Q4: Should burn include P3/discretionary (worst-case) or only P1+P2 (true essentials)? Execute? Y/N: **Y (built 2026-06-05)**
  - ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED (2026-06-05) — `EmergencyFundCard` component in Dashboard.jsx (right after `ForecastCard`, before `export default`). Plan defaults used: savings = **all Savings-category items** (Q1), target floor **3 months** with a 1/3/6-month picker (Q2), **Dashboard card** placed right after the Income Forecast card and before the Spending Calendar (Q3), burn = **P1 + P2 only** (true essentials, Q4 — mirrors `ForecastCard`'s `recurringAllow` set so the two screens reconcile). **Burn** = Σ `Monthly Allowance ($)` for P1/P2 items where `Expense !== 'Savings'`. **Savings on hand** = Σ net all-time allocations into Savings-category buckets (signed `amount` summed per `Type` from `allAllocTx`, using the app's +deposit/−spend convention). **Runway = savings ÷ burn**; 3-tier color (rose <1mo, amber 1–3mo, teal ≥3mo); collapsed header shows the headline "X.X months covered" + progress bar toward target + "$X away from an N-month cushion"; expand reveals savings/burn tiles, the 1/3/6 target picker, the P1+P2 essential-burn breakdown, and per-bucket savings balances. Self-guards (`return null` when burn ≤ 0). New localStorage `_fin_ef_target` (int 1/3/6, default 3 — count only, no financial data). **Zero new API calls, no new sheet tab.** Build passes.
- **Task 36 — Recurring Bill Auto-Detection**: Cut manual subscription entry by surfacing recurring charges the app can already see. PLAN: scan `Allocation Transactions` (already loaded as `allAllocTx`) for repeating signatures — same `Type`/normalized `Description` appearing in ≥2 of the last 3 months at a similar amount (±10%) — then infer cycle from the gap between dates (≈30d monthly, ≈14d biweekly, ≈7d weekly, ≈365d annual). Show a dismissable "🔁 N possible recurring bills detected" card on the Subscriptions modal listing each candidate (name, typical amount, inferred cycle) with **"Add as subscription"** (writes one row to `Subscriptions!A:E` via existing `appendRow`) and **"Ignore"** (remembers the signature in `localStorage._fin_recurring_ignored` so it never re-suggests). Skips anything already in `Subscriptions`. No new sheet tab; new localStorage `_fin_recurring_ignored` (array of signature hashes — no amounts/financial data, just opaque keys). Q1: Detection window — last 3 months or last 6 for higher confidence? Q2: Amount tolerance — ±10% (plan) or stricter/looser? Q3: Match on Description text, Type (budget item), or both? Q4: Auto-add high-confidence matches, or always require your one-tap confirm? Execute? Y/N:
- **Task 37 — Encrypted Data Backup & Restore**: All finances live in one Google Sheet; if it's lost/corrupted there's no local fallback. PLAN: a "💾 Backup" action (Settings/Dashboard footer) that reads every sheet tab via existing `readRange`, bundles them into one JSON snapshot `{version, exportedAt, sheets:{tabName: rows}}`, and downloads it client-side (same `Blob`+anchor pattern as IssueReporter's export) — **encrypted at rest** with the user's PIN via SubtleCrypto AES-GCM (key derived with PBKDF2 from the PIN, reusing `src/lib/pin.js` primitives) so the file is safe to store anywhere. "Restore preview" reads a backup file, decrypts with PIN, and shows a per-tab row-count diff vs. live (read-only preview first — **never auto-overwrites** the sheet without an explicit, typed confirm). Keep it export/restore-preview only in v1; one-click sheet rewrite is a follow-up. No new sheet tab; nothing financial ever touches GitHub (the encrypted file is local-only). Q1: Encrypt with PIN (plan) or also offer a plain-JSON option for power users? Q2: Backup all tabs, or a chosen subset (skip the large Business logs)? Q3: Should v1 include actual sheet-restore (write-back), or preview-only until you've tested it? Q4: Add an optional reminder to back up monthly (e.g. on month close)? Execute? Y/N:

### New Tasks 38–40 (best-practice expansions proposed 2026-06-05) — awaiting Execute Y/N
- **Task 38 — Sinking Funds for Irregular Expenses**: The budget handles monthly bills and (via Subscriptions) annual renewals, but not the *lumpy, non-recurring* costs that wreck a month when they land — car registration/repair, insurance premiums, holidays, gifts, medical. Best practice is a **sinking fund**: decide the total you'll need and by when, and set aside `total ÷ months-remaining` every month so the cash is there when the bill hits. PLAN: (a) reuse the existing **`Plans` sheet** (already powers Goals: `ID,Name,Scope,Target,Saved,Per Month,…`) with a `Scope='Sinking'` value — **no new sheet tab**, and it rides the same read/write paths Goals already use. (b) A compact "🪣 Sinking Funds" section (inside Budget→Goals or its own card) listing each fund: name, target, saved-so-far, **suggested monthly set-aside** = `(target − saved) ÷ months until due`, and an on-track/behind chip (compare actual recent contributions vs the suggestion). (c) "Contribute" logs to `Allocation Transactions` under the fund's `Type` (same pattern Goals will use) so the money is real, not just a sheet number. (d) Dashboard surfaces the **total monthly set-aside across all funds** so it can be folded into the runway/forecast burn. Q1: Separate sinking-funds view, or merge into the Goals page? Q2: Should the suggested set-aside recompute every month as the deadline approaches (true amortization) or stay a flat figure you set once? Q3: Should sinking-fund set-asides count toward the Health-Score savings-rate signal? Q4: Pre-seed a few common funds (Car, Gifts, Insurance, Medical) or start empty? Execute? Y/N:
- **Task 39 — Cash-Flow Low-Balance Forecast**: Runway (Task 35) and the Income Forecast (Task 16) answer "am I OK this month?" but not "will I dip below $0 on the 23rd before payday?" — the single most useful day-to-day question. PLAN: a forward **daily-balance projection** for the next 30–45 days that starts from current cash on hand and walks the calendar applying known future events: subscription due-dates (`Subscriptions` + existing `nextRenewal()`), recurring P1/P2 bill due-days (Task 23's `_fin_due_dates`), and expected paychecks (Task 20's `_fin_payday_config`). Renders a small line/area chart (Recharts, already imported) with a $0 (and configurable buffer) threshold line; **any day the projected balance crosses below the buffer is flagged** with "⚠ Tight around {date} — projected $X". Plain-English takeaway ("You're clear through payday" vs "You may run short ~3 days before payday — consider moving $Y"). Reuses already-loaded `Subscriptions`/`expenses`/`allAllocTx`; needs a "current cash on hand" anchor. Q1: Where does "current cash on hand" come from — sum of `Allocation Summary` balances, a single account balance you enter, or net of all allocations? Q2: Forecast window — 30, 45, or 60 days? Q3: Configurable low-balance buffer (e.g. warn below $100 not just $0)? Q4: Dashboard card or a panel beside the Payday tracker? Execute? Y/N:
- **Task 40 — Spending Anomaly Detection**: Catch the charge that's wrong or out-of-character *before* it quietly blows the budget — a duplicate, a price hike, a mistyped amount, or an unusually large discretionary spend. PLAN: for each spend row in `allAllocTx` (already loaded), build a per-`Type` baseline from that category's trailing history (median + median-absolute-deviation, which is robust to outliers unlike mean/stdev), then **flag any new spend whose amount exceeds `median + k·MAD`** (k≈3) or is a near-duplicate (same Type + amount within a few days). Surface flags as a dismissable "🔎 N unusual charges this month" card (Dashboard or Transactions) listing each: category, amount, date, and why it's flagged ("3× your typical Groceries spend"). Dismissals remembered in `localStorage._fin_anomaly_seen` (opaque row hashes — no amounts). Purely read-only analysis; never edits or deletes a transaction. Q1: Sensitivity — flag at 2× / 3× the category norm, or a tunable slider? Q2: Also flag near-duplicate charges (possible double-entry), or only size anomalies? Q3: Dashboard card, Transactions-page banner, or a push notification? Q4: Minimum history per category before it'll judge (e.g. ≥5 prior spends) to avoid false alarms on new categories? Execute? Y/N: **Y (built 2026-06-06)**
  - ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED (2026-06-06) — `AnomalyCard({ allAllocTx })` in Dashboard.jsx (right before `export default function Dashboard`). Plan defaults used: sensitivity **k=3** (`median + 3·MAD`, `ANOMALY_K`; flat-history fallback flags > 2× median when MAD=0) (Q1); **both** size anomalies and near-duplicates flagged (`ANOMALY_DUP_DAYS=3` — same Type + amount within ±0.50 within 3 days) (Q2); **Dashboard card** placed right after the Budget-Alert banner, above the Health Score, so it reads as an alert (Q3); minimum history **≥5 prior spends** per category (`ANOMALY_MIN_HISTORY=5`) before a category is judged (Q4). Module helpers added: `median()`, `getAnomalySeen()`, pure `detectAnomalies(allAllocTx)`. Only THIS-month spends are surfaced; baseline uses each category's earlier-dated rows only. Dismiss-one / Dismiss-all persist opaque row hashes (`dateStr|type|amount`) to `localStorage._fin_anomaly_seen` (no descriptions stored as data; nothing financial leaves the device). `return null` when no flags. Read-only — never edits/deletes a row. `useMemo` import added. **Zero new API calls, no new sheet tab.** Build passes.

### New Tasks 41–43 (best-practice expansions proposed 2026-06-06) — awaiting Execute Y/N
- **Task 41 — Spending Velocity / Burn-Rate Pace Meter**: Over-budget alerts (Task 6) fire only *after* a category is blown; this catches it *mid-month* by comparing pace to the calendar. PLAN: for the current month, compute **% of monthly allowance already spent** vs **% of the month elapsed** (`day-of-month ÷ days-in-month`), per category and in aggregate. A compact Dashboard "⏱ Spending Pace" card shows an overall gauge ("You've spent 68% of budget with 50% of the month gone — running hot") plus a short list of the categories pacing worst (spent% − elapsed% = the overspend lead), each with a tiny dual bar (spent vs elapsed). Projected month-end spend per category = `spent ÷ elapsed%`, flagged red when it would exceed the allowance. Reuses `allAllocTx` + `expenses` (already loaded) — zero new API calls, no new sheet tab; only in-memory + a collapse state. Q1: Pace threshold to flag "running hot" — spent% exceeds elapsed% by 10pts, 20pts, or a slider? Q2: Per-category list only, or also one headline whole-budget gauge? Q3: Should Savings-category items be excluded from the pace meter (you *want* to front-load savings)? Q4: Dashboard card, or a banner inside Budget→Categories? Q5: Weight by priority (warn louder when a P3/discretionary category is the one running hot)? Execute? Y/N:
- **Task 42 — Category Budget Smart-Suggest (right-size allowances)**: Budgets drift — an allowance set a year ago no longer matches reality. PLAN: a read-only "📐 Right-size your budget" panel (Budget→Categories or a Trends sub-view) that, per category, compares the set `Monthly Allowance ($)` against the **trailing 3-month median actual spend** (median, not mean, so one freak month doesn't skew it). For each category with a meaningful gap (>±15%) it suggests a new allowance ("Groceries: budgeted $300, you average $418 — consider $420") with a one-tap **"Apply"** that writes the new allowance back to the `Monthly Expenses` row via existing `batchUpdateCells`/`appendRow` paths (explicit per-row confirm — never bulk-auto-writes). Surfaces total budgeted vs total typical-spend so the whole plan can be reconciled to real income. Reuses `allAllocTx` + `expenses`. Q1: Baseline window — trailing 3 months (plan) or 6 for stability? Q2: Gap threshold to suggest a change — ±15%, ±20%, or tunable? Q3: Round suggestions to the nearest $5/$10, or exact median? Q4: Apply writes to the sheet (with confirm) or just display the suggestion for you to type in? Q5: Include Savings categories, or only spending categories? Execute? Y/N:
- **Task 43 — What-If Affordability Simulator**: Before a big purchase or a new subscription, answer "can I actually afford this, and what does it cost my runway?" PLAN: a small interactive "🧮 What-If" tool (Dashboard card or Summary panel) where you enter a one-time amount (or a new recurring monthly cost) and it recomputes, live and read-only: the hit to this month's projected net (from `ForecastCard`'s expected-income logic), the change to **Emergency Runway** (Task 35: `(savings − amount) ÷ burn`, or `savings ÷ (burn + newMonthly)`), and a plain-English verdict ("This drops your cushion from 3.4 → 2.9 months — still above your 3-month target" vs "⚠ This would put you below your target — wait ~$X or N weeks"). For recurring costs, also shows the 12-month total and where it ranks against current subscriptions. Pure calculation over already-loaded `expenses`/`allAllocTx`/`subscriptions`/`chartData` — nothing written anywhere, no new sheet tab, no localStorage. Q1: Simulate one-time purchases, recurring costs, or both (plan = both)? Q2: Anchor the verdict to the Emergency-Runway target, the monthly net, or both? Q3: Dashboard card or a Summary→Year panel? Q4: Should it suggest "save $X/mo for N months and you can afford it" for things currently out of reach? Q5: Remember recent what-if scenarios, or always start blank (privacy — no amounts stored)? Execute? Y/N:

### Task Plans Summary (for quick reference)
- **Task 11**: ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED + DOUBLE-CHECKED (2026-06-05). New **"Year" tab** in Summary.jsx. `YearView` component renders instead of the tile grid when `tab==='year'`. Lazy-loads `Monthly Summary!A1:P13` + `Allocation Transactions!A:F` (UNFORMATTED) on first open (`yearLoaded`/`yearLoading` flags) — zero cost to the default Overview paint. Uses **completed months only** (month index < current month) so a stale current-month sheet formula can't skew totals (answer Q1). Shows: YTD Income-vs-Goal bar, YTD Spent/Net + avg-based **year-end projection** (answer Q2), Best-income & Highest-spend month cards, and per-category YTD (allocated vs budgeted + variance ▲/▼ + 12-bar `Sparkline12`) for **all categories** (answer Q3). Helpers added to Summary.jsx: `MONTHS_ABBR`, `CAT_COLORS`, `parseAllocDate()`, `Sparkline12`, `YearView`. Build passes. **DOUBLE-CHECK (2026-06-05):** re-traced Summary.jsx — lazy-load effect (704-719) fires once on Year-tab open via `Promise.allSettled`; `YearView` (434-489) filters to completed months (`_idx < nowMonth`), buckets allocations by `typeToCat`, computes YTD income/spent/net + best/worst + per-category allocated-vs-budgeted variance + `Sparkline12`; tab bar (824-833) + render guard (836-844) correct; build passes. VERIFIED.
- **Task 6**: ✅ VERIFIED + DOUBLE-CHECKED (2026-06-02). Nav badge on Budget nav item (Nav.jsx:66-70, readBudgetBadge from `_fin_budget_alert`). Dashboard amber banner (Dashboard.jsx:810+, `budgetAlerts` state). CategoryView "Not yet funded" chip row (Budget.jsx:691-702). All 3 parts confirmed in code.
- **Task 7**: ✅ VERIFIED + DOUBLE-CHECKED (2026-05-31). Search bar (realtime, matches category/description/amount/account), filter chips (This Month default/Last Month/All Time + Done/Pending status), sort toggle (newest/oldest), CSV copy to clipboard, running balance footer (Net/Count/Avg). Charts only shown in All Time mode. Row limit raised to 1000. `parseSheetDate()` + `monthKey()` helpers added locally. All features code-verified in Transactions.jsx lines 191-617.
- **Task 8**: ✅ VERIFIED + DOUBLE-CHECKED (2026-05-30). Quick-fill template chips in ProcessIncome modal. localStorage key `income_templates` (max 8). State: `templates`, `showManageTpl`, `newTplName`. Chips row above amount input — tap to pre-fill income field (`setIncome(String(t.amount.toFixed(2)))`). Manage mode: ✕ delete per chip + name input + "Save $X.XX" button. "+ Add quick-fill templates" placeholder when empty. All code confirmed at ProcessIncome.jsx lines 103-501.
- **Task 9**: Savings Goals — New "Savings Goals" sheet tab (Name|Target|Current|Deadline|Color|Notes). 5th tab in Budget page ("Goals"). Cards show progress bar, $ remaining, days to deadline, % complete, projected completion date (based on avg monthly contribution from Allocation Transactions). "Contribute" logs to Allocation Transactions as type + updates sheet. Milestones at 25/50/75/100% via push notification, stored in `_fin_goal_milestones = {"GoalName": ["25","50"]}`. CRUD via bottom-drawer. Q: contributions logged to Allocation Transactions or just sheet balance? Dashboard mini-widget for top goal? Color presets for goal cards?
- **Task 10**: ✅ VERIFIED (2026-05-29). Arc gauge on Dashboard (prominent, above month header). 4 signals: Essential Coverage 40pts, Savings Rate 25pts, Allocation Completeness 20pts, Over-Budget Penalty -15pts max. Target 80 marked in amber. Expandable breakdown. 6-month history sparkline (localStorage). Browser push notification when score < 40 (once/day). Code verified: signals compute correctly at Dashboard.jsx:297-330; gauge renders correctly (240° arc, GAUGE_START=150, gap at bottom); health card at line 725.
- **Task 11**: YTD Budget Summary — new tab in Summary page. Shows total income vs goal, per-category YTD actuals vs budget, best/worst month cards.
- **Task 12 (EXPANDED 2026-06-04)**: Commission & Art Income Tracker Improvements — bridge finished commissions into the income pipeline so art money stops being invisible to the budget.
  - **Outstanding badge** on the ✦ Art nav item (Nav.jsx): count of `Inquiries` rows where Status is Accepted/In-Progress but not Paid (i.e., `Price Agreed > 0` and `Paid Amount < Price Agreed`). Same badge-reader pattern as the Budget over-budget badge (`_fin_budget_alert`), but computed live from the `Inquiries` sheet — cache the count in `localStorage._fin_art_outstanding` on Commissions load so the nav can paint it without its own API call.
  - **"Mark Paid + Process" action** on each commission card (Commissions.jsx): when an inquiry is marked Paid, (a) write `Paid Amount` + Status=Paid back to the `Inquiries` row, and (b) deep-link to ProcessIncome pre-filled with the paid amount and a `[Commission]` source tag (ties into Task 27's source-tag prefix). One tap turns "client paid me" into a logged, allocated deposit.
  - **Outstanding A/R tile** at top of Commissions: Σ unpaid `Price Agreed − Paid Amount` ("$X across N commissions awaiting payment") + a small aged list (oldest first by inquiry date).
  - **This-month art income** stat: Σ `Allocation Transactions` rows tagged `[Commission]` (or descriptions matching paid inquiries) for the current month, shown on the Commissions header and feeding the Dashboard income-source breakdown (Task 27).
  - No new sheet tab — reuses `Inquiries`. New localStorage: `_fin_art_outstanding` (int, badge cache only — no financial data).
  - Q1: When marking Paid, should the deposit be auto-created in ProcessIncome, or should I just pre-fill the modal and let you confirm the allocation? Q2: Count an inquiry as "outstanding" the moment Status=Accepted, or only once `Price Agreed` is set? Q3: Should partial payments (`Paid < Agreed`) show a progress bar per commission? Q4: Tag art deposits as `[Commission]` (shared with Task 27) or a distinct `[Art]`?
  - Execute? Y/N:
- **Task 13**: Subscription cost insights — annual cost view, cost ranking, 90-day renewal calendar, month-over-month subscription trend.
- **Task 14**: Net Worth Snapshot — "Net Worth" sheet tab (Date|Account|Type(Asset/Liability)|Balance|Notes). Asset types: Checking/Savings/Investment/Property/Vehicle/Cash/Other. Liability types: Credit Card/Student Loan/Car Loan/Medical/Personal/Other. Dashboard card: Total Assets, Total Liabilities, Net Worth (green/red), MoM delta. Trend line chart (monthly snapshots over time). "Update Balance" → per-account modal prefills last known balance. Auto-snapshot on month close OR manual anytime. Q: which accounts to track? standalone page or Dashboard card? liabilities as positive (app negates) or negative? target net worth marker?
- **Task 15 (EXPANDED 2026-06-04)**: Tax Prep Summary — a once-a-year read-only report that buckets the year's money into tax-relevant categories so filing (or handing off to an accountant) is copy/paste, not archaeology.
  - **Placement**: a "Tax" sub-view inside the Summary page's Year tab (built in Task 11), lazy-loaded so it costs nothing on the default paint — reuses the already-fetched `Allocation Transactions!A:F` + `Business Transactions` + `Business Expenses` ranges where possible.
  - **Income buckets**: 1099/Business (sum of `Business Transactions` revenue + art `[Commission]` deposits), W2/Wages (Allocation income tagged `[Paycheck]` per Task 27, else "Untagged income"), Other. Shows gross per bucket for the selected tax year.
  - **Deduction buckets** (business only — personal spending is not deductible): COGS (Σ `Business Expenses` Category=materials/supplies), Business OpEx (other `Business Expenses`), Mileage (gas gallons × IRS standard rate OR actual gas spend — your choice), Subscriptions used for business. Each bucket lists its line items on expand.
  - **Estimated net self-employment income** = business income − business deductions, with a plain-English caveat banner ("Estimate only — not tax advice; confirm with a professional"). Optionally show a rough set-aside suggestion (e.g. "consider reserving ~25–30% for taxes").
  - **Export**: "📋 Copy tax summary" (plaintext, same pattern as Task 31's `copyStatementText`) + reuse the print path for a clean one-pager. No new sheet tab; no new financial data leaves the sheet.
  - Q1: Which tax year basis — calendar Jan–Dec, and should I let you pick a prior year? Q2: Mileage deduction via IRS standard mileage rate (needs your annual business miles) or just actual gas spend? Q3: Do you want a tax set-aside % suggestion, and at what rate? Q4: Which `Business Expenses` categories map to COGS vs OpEx (I'll need your category list, or infer from existing ones)? Q5: Should personal charitable/medical/etc. ever be tracked, or keep this business-only?
  - Execute? Y/N:
- **Task 16 (EXPANDED 2026-06-04)**: Recurring Income Forecast — a forward-looking "what's likely coming in vs going out" projection for the next 3 months, so the budget stops being purely backward-looking.
  - **Placement**: collapsible card on Dashboard (below the 6-Month Trend card), or a panel in Summary→Year — defaults collapsed, zero new API calls (reuses `chartData` / `allAllocTx` already loaded).
  - **Income forecast**: per upcoming month, project income = mean of the last-6 completed months' income (matches the Dragon's `dragonOverview.js` "personal income = mean of last-6 positive" so figures reconcile). Show a low/expected/high band (min/mean/max of last-6) rather than a single false-precision number.
  - **Fixed outflows**: subscriptions due in each forecast month (from `Subscriptions` + existing `nextRenewal()`/cycle math) + the recurring P1/P2 budget allowances (`Monthly Expenses`). 
  - **Projected net per month** = forecast income − (subscriptions + recurring allowances), green/red, with a 3-month cumulative "runway/surplus" line.
  - **Visual**: small grouped bar or line chart (reuse Recharts already imported) — 3 future months, income band vs committed outflows. Plain-English takeaway sentence (e.g. "On your recent average you'll clear ~$X/mo after fixed bills").
  - No new sheet tab, no new localStorage (view state in-memory). Past months always read the frozen sheet; only future months are projected.
  - Q1: Forecast horizon — 3 months (plan) or would you prefer 6? Q2: Base the income average on last-6 months, last-3, or trailing-12? Q3: Should one-off/irregular art commissions be included in the average or excluded as non-recurring? Q4: Place on Dashboard or in Summary→Year? Q5: Show the low/expected/high band, or just a single expected line to keep it simple?
  - Execute? Y/N: **Y (built 2026-06-05)**
  - ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED (2026-06-05) — `ForecastCard` component in Dashboard.jsx (before `export default`, right after `TrendChartCard`). Defaults used per plan: horizon **3 months** (`FORECAST_MONTHS=3`), income average = **last-6 positive-income months** from `chartData` (mirrors the Dragon's convention), **low/expected/high band** shown. Collapsed by default (`forecastExpanded` state). Rendered between the 6-Month Trend and Spending Calendar cards, guarded by `chartData.length >= 2` (component self-guards on `last6.length < 2`). Committed outflows per month = `subsDueInMonth(subscriptions, monthIndex)` (annual bills land only in their anniversary month; monthly/weekly/biweekly use `toMonthly()` run-rate) + recurring P1+P2 `Monthly Expenses` allowances. Per-month net + 3-month cumulative runway + plain-English takeaway. **Zero new API calls, no new sheet tab, no new localStorage.** Build passes. **DOUBLE-CHECK (2026-06-06):** re-traced `ForecastCard` (Dashboard.jsx 425-520) + `subsDueInMonth` (412-423) + `FORECAST_MONTHS=3` (408). `last6` = `chartData` incomes >0 sliced to 6, guard `<2` returns null; expected=mean, low/high=min/max; `recurringAllow`=Σ P1+P2 allowances >0; each forecast month `mi=(now.month+1+i)%12`, outflow=`subsDueInMonth(mi)+recurringAllow` (annual subs only count in anniversary month, others use `toMonthly()` run-rate), net=expected−outflow, cumulative accumulates; runway=cumulative drives the takeaway sentence. Math + guards correct; build passes. VERIFIED.
- **Task 17**: ✅ VERIFIED (2026-05-29) + DOUBLE-CHECKED (2026-05-30). TrendChartCard component in Dashboard.jsx (before `export default`). Collapsed by default; tap ▼ to expand. Grouped bar chart (teal=income, rose=expenses), last 6 months from `chartData.slice(-6)`. Delta summary: last-mo vs prev income/expense delta + 6-mo avg net. Zero new API calls — uses `chartData` (Monthly Summary already loaded). State: `trendExpanded` in Dashboard. Chart uses existing Recharts BarChart import. Code re-verified 2026-05-30: `incDelta`, `sptDelta`, `avgNet` computations confirmed correct; guard `if (last6.length < 2) return null` confirmed present.
- **Task 18**: ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED (2026-05-31). ✎ pencil button next to month/year header on Dashboard opens a bottom-drawer text input (max 200 chars). Saved note shows as italic grey chip below month name (tap to edit). MonthlyDetail page shows note as subtle callout at top. Storage: localStorage `_fin_month_notes = { "YYYY-M": text }`. saveMonthNote() in Dashboard.jsx; getMonthNote() helper in MonthlyDetail.jsx (tries current year then previous year). State: `monthNote`, `showNoteDrawer`, `noteInput`.
- **Task 19 (EXPANDED)**: Split Transaction Entry — In AddModal, "+ Add Split" button adds Category+Amount pairs (up to 5). Shared fields: Date/Description/Account/Status. Running tally vs total. Batch-appends to Allocation Transactions (no schema change). Grouped display in transaction list with ⛓ icon. Q1: max splits 3 or 5? Q2: visual grouping in both Chronological and By Category views, or just Chronological? Q3: fixed total first, then split it — OR per-row amounts that auto-sum? Q4: should split rows appear as individual entries in Budget Categories view? Q5: save common split configurations as templates?
- **Task 20 (EXPANDED)**: Payday Tracker — localStorage `_fin_payday_config = { schedule, startDate }`. Schedule types: Bi-weekly / Semi-monthly (1st & 15th) / Monthly. Dashboard chip: "💰 Paycheck in X days" (green >7d, amber 3-7d, red <3d). Spending-pace warning: "You've spent Y% of income with Z% of pay cycle elapsed." Optional push notification the evening before payday. Q1: what is your pay schedule? Q2: chip on Dashboard only or Budget page too? Q3: would you like an evening-before push notification? Q4: how many past pay periods to look back to confirm history? Q5: custom spending-pace warning threshold (e.g. warn when >80% spent with >50% cycle remaining)?
- **Task 21**: ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED + DOUBLE-CHECKED (2026-06-03). localStorage `_fin_cat_notes = { "TypeName": "text" }`. `getCatNotes()` helper in Budget.jsx (line 67-68). `CategoryItemCard`: ✎ button (ml-auto in type name flex row, line 558-564) → bottom-drawer textarea (160 chars, autoFocus, Clear+Save, lines 632-666). `saveNote()` at lines 519-526 writes/deletes from map. Note shown as italic clickable button below Account (lines 569-574). `BudgetCard` reads `getCatNotes()[type]` at line 378, shows read-only italic gray text (lines 389-393).
- **Task 22**: ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED (2026-05-31). On Dashboard load, scans subscriptions for renewals within lead time (default 3 days). Fires grouped push notification. localStorage `_fin_sub_notif_sent = { "YYYY-MM-DD": ["Name1",...] }` for dedup. Lead time (1/3/7 days) via ⚙ gear in Subscriptions modal header → mini-picker. Uses existing `nextRenewal()` + `daysUntil()` helpers + Notification API from Task 10. `subNotifLead` state at Dashboard level. `showNotifPicker`/`leadVal` states in SubsModal.
- **Task 23**: ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED + DOUBLE-CHECKED (2026-05-31). localStorage `_fin_due_dates = { "TypeName": dayNum }`. Budget→Categories `CategoryItemCard`: per-item "📅 Due Xth" chip (tap to open select 1-31 + "No date"); shows "⚠ Past due" (rose) or "⏰ Due in Nd" (amber) badges when unfunded. Dashboard banner: `dueAlerts[]` computed as unfunded items with `0 <= diff <= 3` days. ProcessIncome: badges in allocation rows. All 3 files verified: Budget.jsx:46-546, Dashboard.jsx:362-375+818-821, ProcessIncome.jsx:100-655.
- **Task 26**: Debt Payoff Tracker — "Debts" sheet tab (Name|Type|Balance|InterestRate|MinPayment|Account|TargetDate|Notes). Dashboard card: total debt, # accounts, total min payment (rose if debt > income). Per-debt detail: months to payoff at min vs +$X extra (slider), interest saved. Toggle Avalanche (highest APR) vs Snowball (smallest balance) order — shows total interest difference between strategies. Milestones at 25/50/75/100% → push notification, stored `_fin_debt_milestones`. "Log Payment" → updates Balance in sheet + logs to Allocation Transactions. Q: what debt types do you have? standalone page or Dashboard card? show avalanche/snowball interest difference? payments reduce budget allocation?
- **Task 27 (EXPANDED 2026-06-03)**: Income Source Tagging — Source chip row in ProcessIncome modal above Description: 💼 Paycheck | 🎨 Commission | 🏪 Business | ⚡ Side Work | 💡 Other. Tapping auto-prefixes description with `[SourceName]`. Last-used source remembered in `_fin_last_source` localStorage. No schema change — prefix stored in existing Description col (col D). Extract regex: `/^\[([^\]]+)\]\s*/`. Dashboard income stat card gains collapsible breakdown: horizontal bars per source (teal/indigo/amber/slate), only shown when >1 source. Backward-compat: rows without prefix counted as "Untagged." Transactions page gains "Source" filter chip row (client-side extraction). Q1: Which sources do you use — Paycheck / Art Commission / Business / Side Work / Tips / Rental / Other? Q2: Should the [Source] prefix be hidden in most views or always shown? Q3: Should Business income auto-tag from ProcessIncome when amount matches a recent Business Transaction profit?
- **Task 28**: Monthly Budget Rollover — Per-category rollover toggle in Budget→Categories. Unused allocation carries to next month. Storage: `_fin_rollover_cats` (enabled categories array) + `_fin_rollover_credit = { "YYYY-M": { "TypeName": amount } }`. Rollover credit shown as "+$X.XX rollover from last month" in category cards. Q: which categories? credit counts toward goal or bonus? reset on toggle-off?
- **Task 24 (EXPANDED 2026-06-03)**: Spending Calendar Heatmap — 7-col × 6-week grid, day cells color-graded slate→rose by daily spend (4 tiers: $0 / $1–$50 / $50–$150 / $150+, scaled to month max). Income days get teal dot in cell corner instead of rose fill. Data from `allAllocTx` (already loaded by Dashboard — zero new API calls). Placement: collapsible card on Dashboard below TrendChartCard. Month navigation ← → arrows. Day-tap opens absolute-positioned overlay listing all txns for that day (category + truncated desc + amount) with day total. Color scale legend (5-dot gradient row) below grid. No new localStorage needed (view state is in-memory). Q1: Dashboard collapsible card or Budget→Entries toggle? Q2: Show income days in teal? Q3: "Heavy spend" threshold — $100, $150, or $200? Q4: Default to current month or most recently completed month?
- **Task 25**: Budget Category Reorder & Pinning — 📌 pin per category card floats it to top of its priority group. Drag-or-arrows reorder within tiers. localStorage `_fin_cat_order = { "TypeName": sortIndex }`. Reset to default button. Q: drag-and-drop vs up/down arrows? Visual pin indicator? Order persists across months?
- **Task 29**: ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED + DOUBLE-CHECKED (2026-06-05). Horizontal scrollable chip row inserted below month header in Dashboard.jsx. 4 default chips: 💰 Process Income (opens ProcessIncome modal, shows teal dot badge when no alloc rows yet) | 📝 Log Transaction (navigate /transactions) | 📊 This Month (navigate MonthlyDetail) | 📅 Bill Calendar (scrollIntoView via billCalRef). ⚙ gear toggles edit mode: ▲/▼ reorder, ✕ remove, dashed "+" chips to add hidden actions back. Order+visibility persisted to localStorage `_fin_quickactions`. State: `qaActions` (array of IDs), `showQAEdit` (bool). Ref: `billCalRef = useRef(null)` placed on `<div>` before Bill Calendar section. No new API calls. **DOUBLE-CHECK (2026-06-05):** re-traced Dashboard.jsx — `qaActions` lazy-init from `_fin_quickactions` with default `['income','log','month','cal']` (731-737); `ALL_QA` defs + `saveQA`/`moveUp`/`moveDown`/`remove`/`add` all persist to localStorage on every mutation (1685-1698); the 4 click handlers are correctly wired (income→`setShowIncome(true)`, log→`navigate('/transactions')`, month→`navigate('/month/'+reportLinks[currentMonth]+...)` guarded on the link existing, cal→`billCalRef.current?.scrollIntoView`); income teal-dot badge gates on `hasCurrentMonthAllocRows === false`; edit-mode ▲/▼/✕ + dashed "+ hidden" chips + ⚙/Done toggle render correctly; `billCalRef` div confirmed at line 1961. Build passes. VERIFIED.
- **Task 30 (EXPANDED 2026-06-03)**: Weekly Spending Digest — Trigger: on Dashboard load, check `_fin_digest_config`; fire if `enabled:true` AND today is configured day-of-week AND `lastFired !== today (YYYY-MM-DD)`. Notification line 1: "📊 Week of [Mon DD] — $X allocated ([Y]% of monthly budget)". Line 2: "Top: [Category] ($X)". Appended if P1 unfunded: "⚠ N essential items still unfunded." "This week" = rolling last-7-days from today. In-app fallback card: dismissable teal card below Health Score card, visible for that calendar day only (works even if notifications denied). Stores dismissal in `_fin_digest_config.lastDismissed`. Config UI: "📬 Weekly Digest" toggle + day-of-week picker (Mon–Sun) shown when enabled + "Test Notification" button. Data: reuses `allAllocTx` (already loaded), zero new API calls. localStorage: `_fin_digest_config = { enabled, dayOfWeek, lastFired, lastDismissed }`. Q1: Preferred day of week? Q2: Rolling last-7-days or fixed Mon–Sun week? Q3: Should in-app card include a mini % budget progress bar? Q4: If notifications are blocked, should in-app card still show as fallback?
- **Task 31**: ✅ COMPLETED + VERIFIED (2026-06-04). PDF/Print Monthly Statement — `printStatement()` already had summary grid + priority budget tables + full txn table + print CSS + HTML escaping. This pass ADDED: (a) month-note callout (`.note-callout`, amber left-rule, read from `_fin_month_notes` for the statement's month so it works for current AND closed months); (b) **Top Expenses** section (top-5 negative-only categories from `catMap`, with share-of-spend %); (c) Health-Score line in the header meta (`healthScore.total`/100 when loaded); (d) new **`copyStatementText()`** — builds a plain-text version of the same statement and copies via `navigator.clipboard` (with `execCommand('copy')` textarea fallback for insecure contexts). UI: "📋 Copy text" button left of "🖨 Save PDF" in the statement modal header, flips to "✓ Copied" for 2s via `stmtCopied` state. Presentation-only — zero sheet writes, zero new API calls, all data already loaded. Build passes.

### Build summary (latest run, 2026-06-06)
**Task 40 (Spending Anomaly Detection) is COMPLETED.** New read-only `AnomalyCard` on the Dashboard (right after the Budget-Alert banner, above the Health Score) flags this-month spends that are out of character: per category it builds a robust baseline from that category's earlier-dated history (**median + 3·MAD** — median-absolute-deviation, which a single freak charge can't skew) and flags any charge above the threshold ("3.1× your typical Groceries (~$120)") or that looks like a **double-entry** (same category + amount within ±$0.50 and ±3 days). Needs ≥5 prior spends before judging a category, so new categories don't false-alarm. Dismiss-one / Dismiss-all persist **opaque row hashes** (`date|type|amount`) to `localStorage._fin_anomaly_seen` — no amounts/descriptions stored as data, nothing financial leaves the device. Purely read-only: never edits or deletes a transaction. **Zero new API calls, no new sheet tab; build passes.** Separately, **Task 16 (Recurring Income Forecast) was double-checked and VERIFIED** by re-tracing `ForecastCard` + `subsDueInMonth` (annual subs only count in their anniversary month; others use the monthly run-rate) — income band, P1+P2 outflows, per-month net and cumulative runway all correct. Three new best-practice tasks (**41 Spending-Velocity Pace Meter**, **42 Category Budget Smart-Suggest**, **43 What-If Affordability Simulator**) were drafted with plans + Execute? Y/N markers. No Report-Issue feedback is older than one month (oldest in `issues/processed.json` is 2026-05-29), so nothing was pruned this run.

### Prior build summary (2026-06-05 #2)
**Task 35 (Emergency Fund / Runway Tracker) is COMPLETED.** New `EmergencyFundCard` on the Dashboard (right after `ForecastCard`) shows how many months of essentials your savings cover: **runway = savings-on-hand ÷ monthly essential burn**, where burn = Σ P1+P2 `Monthly Expenses` allowances (the same set `ForecastCard` commits to, so the two reconcile) and savings = net all-time allocations into Savings-category buckets from `allAllocTx`. Collapsed header shows "X.X months covered" + a 3-tier (rose/amber/teal) progress bar toward a 1/3/6-month target (`_fin_ef_target`, default 3) + a "$X away from an N-month cushion" line; expanding reveals savings/burn tiles, the target picker, the essential-burn breakdown, and per-bucket savings balances. **Zero new API calls, no new sheet tab; build passes.** Separately, **Task 29 (Dashboard Quick-Actions) was double-checked and VERIFIED** by re-tracing the localStorage-backed state, the 4 wired actions, edit-mode reorder/remove/add, and the `billCalRef` scroll target in Dashboard.jsx. Three new best-practice tasks (**38 Sinking Funds**, **39 Cash-Flow Low-Balance Forecast**, **40 Spending Anomaly Detection**) were drafted with plans + Execute? Y/N markers. No Report-Issue feedback is older than one month (oldest is 2026-05-29), so nothing was pruned this run.

### Prior build summary (2026-06-05 #1)
**Task 16 (Recurring Income Forecast) is COMPLETED.** New `ForecastCard` on the Dashboard projects the next 3 months: expected income (mean of the last-6 positive-income months, shown as a low/expected/high band) vs committed outflows (subscriptions due that month + recurring P1/P2 budget allowances), with per-month net, a 3-month cumulative runway line, and a plain-English takeaway — all reusing already-loaded `chartData`/`subscriptions`/`expenses` (zero new API calls, no new sheet tab, no new localStorage; build passes). Separately, **Task 11 (YTD Year tab) was double-checked and VERIFIED** by re-tracing the lazy-load + `YearView` math in Summary.jsx. Three new best-practice tasks (**35 Emergency-Fund Runway**, **36 Recurring-Bill Auto-Detection**, **37 Encrypted Backup & Restore**) were drafted with plans + Execute? Y/N markers.

### Prior build summary (2026-06-04)
**Task 31 (PDF/Print Monthly Statement) is COMPLETED.** The printable statement now includes a month-note callout, a Top-Expenses section, and a header health-score line, plus a new "📋 Copy text" button that copies a clean plain-text version of the statement to the clipboard — all presentation-only with no sheet writes and the build passing. Separately, **Task 24/33 (Spending Calendar income-vs-spend) was double-checked and VERIFIED** as already correct on `main` (income days paint teal, never rose). No Report-Issue feedback is older than one month, so nothing was pruned from the issues sheet this run.

## Monthly Statement (Task 31) — COMPLETED + VERIFIED 2026-06-04
- Two builders in Dashboard.jsx, both inside the component (closure access to `monthNote`, `healthScore`, `pm`, `MONTHS`):
  - `printStatement(current, stmtTxns, expenses, currentMonth, currentYear)` — opens a print window, `document.write(html)`, auto-`print()` after 600ms. All sheet-sourced strings go through `esc()` before injection (XSS guard for `document.write`).
  - `copyStatementText(...)` — same data, plain-text output, `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with a hidden-textarea `execCommand` fallback. Sets `stmtCopied` (2s).
- Statement month note read fresh from `_fin_month_notes[`${year}-${MONTHS.indexOf(month)+1}`]` (NOT the `monthNote` state) so it's correct for closed months too.
- Top Expenses = top-5 of `catMap` where `spend>0` (negative rows only — income/deposits never appear here); share % = `spend / totalSpent`.
- UI buttons live in the Monthly Statement modal sticky header (`showStatement`), only when `!stmtLoading && !stmtError`: "📋 Copy text" (slate) then "🖨 Save PDF" (blue).
- Print CSS: `@page letter`, `@media print { print-color-adjust: exact }`, `.note-callout` amber left-rule.

## Spending Calendar income/spend correctness (Tasks 24 & 33) — VERIFIED 2026-06-04
- Double-checked the "calendar shows income as expenses" report (Task 33). **Resolved on main — no code change needed.**
- Data flow: `allAllocTx` rows carry `amount: pm(r[2])` = raw signed sheet value. ARCHITECTURE.md §2 fixes the convention: Allocation Transactions col C = **+deposit / −spend**.
- `SpendingCalendarCard` reducer (Dashboard.jsx ~199): `amount>0 → income`, else `→ spend (abs)`. `spendColor()` colors rose ONLY when `spend>0`; a pure-income day (`spend===0 && income>0`) returns teal `bg-teal-800/60`. The corner teal dot shows only when a day has BOTH income and spend. ⇒ an income row can never paint a day rose. Verified by trace; build passes.

## Emergency Fund / Runway Tracker (Task 35) — COMPLETED + VERIFIED 2026-06-05
- Component `EmergencyFundCard({ expenses, allAllocTx, expanded, onToggle })` in Dashboard.jsx, defined immediately after `ForecastCard` (before `export default function Dashboard`).
- **Burn** = Σ `pm(e['Monthly Allowance ($)'])` for `expenses` where Priority ∈ {1,2} and `Expense !== 'Savings'` — same essential set as `ForecastCard`'s `recurringAllow`, so the two cards reconcile.
- **Savings on hand** = for each `allAllocTx` row whose `type` is in the set of `expenses` Types with `Expense === 'Savings'`, sum the signed `amount` (deposits + / spends −). Total across buckets = savings.
- **Runway** = `savings / burn` (months). Tiers: rose `<1`, amber `1–3`, teal `≥3`. `return null` when `burn <= 0`.
- Target cushion: module helper `getEFTarget()` reads localStorage `_fin_ef_target` (allowed values 1/3/6, default 3 — integer count only, no financial data). In-card 1/3/6 picker calls `pickTarget(n)` which sets state + writes localStorage.
- Collapsed header: "X.X months covered" + progress bar (`pct = min(1, runway/target)`) + shortfall line (`max(0, burn*target − savings)`). Expanded: savings/burn tiles, target picker, P1+P2 burn breakdown (sorted desc), per-bucket savings balances.
- State `efExpanded` in Dashboard; rendered after `ForecastCard`, before `SpendingCalendarCard`, guarded by `expenses.length > 0 && allAllocTx.length > 0`. Zero new API calls, no new sheet tab.

## Spending Anomaly Detection (Task 40) — COMPLETED + VERIFIED 2026-06-06
- Component `AnomalyCard({ allAllocTx })` in Dashboard.jsx, defined immediately before `export default function Dashboard`. Rendered after the Budget-Alert banner, before the Health Score (reads as an alert). Guarded by `allAllocTx.length > 0`. `return null` when no flags survive dismissal.
- Module helpers (above the component): `median(nums)`, `getAnomalySeen()` (reads `_fin_anomaly_seen`), and pure `detectAnomalies(allAllocTx)`.
- Constants: `ANOMALY_K=3` (median + 3·MAD), `ANOMALY_MIN_HISTORY=5` (prior spends needed before a category is judged), `ANOMALY_DUP_DAYS=3`.
- `detectAnomalies`: spends = `allAllocTx` rows with `amount < 0` (abs = |amount|), grouped by `type`. Only THIS-month rows (`dateStr.startsWith('YYYY-MM')`) become candidates. (1) **Size**: baseline = same-type rows with `dateStr < candidate.dateStr`; if ≥5, `med=median(prior)`, `mad=median(|x−med|)`, threshold = `mad>0 ? med+3·mad : med·2`; flag when `abs>threshold` → reason "N× your typical {type}". (2) **Duplicate** (only if not already size-flagged): another same-type row within ±$0.50 and ±3 days with `dateStr <= candidate` → reason "possible double-entry — same as {date}".
- Each flag: `{hash, type, abs, dateStr, desc, reason}`; `hash = "dateStr|type|abs.toFixed(2)"`.
- Dismissals: `dismiss(hash)` / `dismissAll()` add hashes to a Set and persist `[...set]` to `localStorage._fin_anomaly_seen` (opaque hashes — no amounts/descriptions stored as data). `flags` recomputed via `useMemo([allAllocTx, seen])` and filtered against `seen`.
- Read-only: never writes to the sheet, never edits/deletes a transaction. `useMemo` added to the React import. Zero new API calls, no new sheet tab.

## Dashboard Quick-Actions Strip (Task 29) — COMPLETED + VERIFIED + DOUBLE-CHECKED 2026-06-05
- localStorage key: `_fin_quickactions = ["income","log","month","cal"]` (ordered array of visible action IDs)
- State in Dashboard.jsx: `qaActions` (array, lazy-init from localStorage), `showQAEdit` (bool)
- Ref: `billCalRef = useRef(null)` — placed on `<div>` immediately before the Bill Calendar section
- 4 predefined actions: `income` (opens ProcessIncome modal) · `log` (navigate /transactions) · `month` (navigate MonthlyDetail) · `cal` (scrollIntoView billCalRef)
- `income` chip shows teal dot badge when `hasCurrentMonthAllocRows === false` (no alloc rows yet this month)
- ⚙ gear toggles edit mode: ▲/▼ reorder within array, ✕ removes from array, dashed "+ [label]" chips add hidden actions back
- Saves to localStorage on every mutation (remove/add/reorder)
- Placed below month header (`{/* ── Quick-Actions Strip ── */}` comment), above gas price chip
- No new API calls

## Category Notes System (Task 21) — VERIFIED + DOUBLE-CHECKED 2026-06-03
- localStorage key: `_fin_cat_notes = { "TypeName": "note text" }` — persists across months
- `getCatNotes()` helper in Budget.jsx (after `getDueDates()` line ~54)
- `CategoryItemCard`: `note` state (lazy init), `showNoteDrawer`, `noteInput` state
- `openNoteDrawer()` pre-fills `noteInput`; `saveNote(text)` writes/deletes from localStorage map
- ✎ button with `ml-auto` in type name flex-wrap row; note displays as italic clickable button below Account
- Bottom-drawer modal: 160-char textarea, char counter, Clear + Save buttons, `autoFocus`
- `BudgetCard` (Budget Plan tab): reads `getCatNotes()[type]` at render — shows read-only italic gray text below item name

## Subscription Renewal Notification System (Task 22) — COMPLETED 2026-05-31
- localStorage key: `_fin_sub_notif_lead` = "1"|"3"|"7" (days ahead; default 3)
- localStorage key: `_fin_sub_notif_sent = { "YYYY-MM-DD": ["SubName1", "SubName2"] }` (dedup per day)
- Notification fires on Dashboard mount, after subscriptions loaded, inside `Promise.all` `.then` handler
- Uses existing `nextRenewal(startDateStr, cycle)` + `daysUntil(date)` helpers (defined at top of Dashboard.jsx)
- Single notification for 1 qualifying sub; grouped notification listing all when multiple
- UI: `subNotifLead` state at Dashboard component level; `showNotifPicker`/`leadVal` states inside SubsModal
- ⚙ gear button in Subscriptions modal header → mini-popover with 1d/3d/7d buttons; closes on selection

## Month Note System (Task 18) — VERIFIED 2026-05-31
- localStorage key: `_fin_month_notes = { "YYYY-M": "text" }` e.g. `"2026-5": "Big tax month"`
- Dashboard state: `monthNote` (lazy init), `showNoteDrawer` (bool), `noteInput` (string)
- `saveMonthNote(text)` writes/deletes the key for `${now.getFullYear()}-${now.getMonth()+1}`
- ✎ button inline with month/year h1; italic chip below heading when note exists (tap to edit)
- Bottom-drawer modal: `autoFocus` textarea, 200-char limit + char counter, Clear + Save buttons
- MonthlyDetail: `getMonthNote(monthName)` helper — scans MONTH_NAMES array, tries current year key then prior year
